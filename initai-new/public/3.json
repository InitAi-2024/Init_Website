        "Machine Learning is a complex discipline but implementing machine program's or models is far less daunting and difficult that's due to various machine learning framework such as Google's Tensorflow, pyTorch, Microsoft's CNTX, NEXT. Created By Google Brain team, TensorFlow is an open source library for Numerical Computation and large scale Machine learning.",
        "In TensorFlow all the computations involve tensors where tensors are the standard way of representing the data in machine learning or deep learning models. A tensor is a vector or matrix of n-Dimensions that represents the data type. All the operations are conducted inside a graph and a graph is a set of computation that take place successively. Each operation is called an open node and they are connected to each other. TensorFlow allows the user to create data flow graphs which describe how data moves through a graph and a series of processing nodes. Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation and each connection is a multidimensional array or tensor."

        "Tensors are the de facto standard for representing data in deep learning. They are essentially multidimensional arrays that allow you to represent data having higher dimensions. In deep learning, you typically deal with high dimensional datasets where dimensions refer to different features present in the dataset.",
        "In the image above, you can see how tensors can represent data in various dimensions. The term 'TensorFlow' is derived from the operations that neural networks perform on tensors - it's literally a flow of tensors through a series of mathematical operations."
