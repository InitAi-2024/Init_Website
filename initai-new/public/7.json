        "This research investigates the efficacy of various Graph Neural Network (GNN) model architectures in traffic prediction tasks. We compare standard GNN models with two variants: one excluding edge features and another utilizing a k-nearest neighbors graph structure. Our comprehensive comparative analysis examines prediction accuracy and computational efficiency across these models. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN models significantly outperform the Baseline model in both prediction accuracy and training efficiency. Among the models tested, the GNN architecture incorporating edge, node, and global features achieves superior performance, emphasizing the importance of graph structures in traffic prediction."

        "Traffic congestion is a major global issue, leading to increased travel times, fuel consumption, and pollution. Traditional traffic forecasting methods rely on historical data and statistical models, which often fail to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic patterns. Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their potential in traffic forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal relationships in road networks. This study explores various GNN architectures to evaluate their effectiveness in improving traffic prediction accuracy."

        "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilize a message passing mechanism, where node and edge features propagate across the graph structure to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies. This enables GNNs to model intricate traffic patterns effectively.",
        "In the comparison between the baseline model and GNN models:",
        "Loss Plot Comparison: All models demonstrate a consistent decrease in loss over epochs, indicating effective learning. GNN models exhibit faster convergence and lower validation losses compared to the baseline model.",
        "Abnormally High Traffic Comparison: The baseline model struggles to capture complex spatial and temporal patterns, leading to less accurate predictions during such peaks. In contrast, the GNN models effectively utilize spatial dependencies, delivering significantly better predictive accuracy. This demonstrates the robustness of GNNs in handling anomalous traffic conditions, underscoring their superiority over traditional models like FCNNs."
